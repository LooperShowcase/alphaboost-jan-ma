      In 1938, during Japanese-ruled Korea, Lee Byung-chul (1910–1987) of a
      large landowning family in the Uiryeong county moved to nearby Daegu city
      and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company (株式会社三星商会 (Kabushiki gaisha
      Mitsuboshi Shōkai)), or Samsung Sanghoe (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung
      started out as a small trading company with forty employees located in
      Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong).[16] It dealt in dried-fish,[16] locally-grown
      groceries and noodles. The company prospered and Lee moved its head office
      to Seoul in 1947. When the Korean War broke out, he was forced to leave
      Seoul. He started a sugar refinery in Busan named Cheil Jedang. In 1954,
      Lee founded Cheil Mojik and built the plant in Chimsan-dong, Daegu. It was
      the largest woollen mill ever in the country.[citation needed] Samsung
      diversified into many different areas. Lee sought to establish Samsung as
      a leader in a wide range of industries. Samsung moved into lines of
      business such as insurance, securities, and retail. In 1947, Cho Hong-jai,
      the Hyosung group's founder, jointly invested in a new company called
      Samsung Mulsan Gongsa, or the Samsung Trading Corporation, with the
      Samsung's founder Lee Byung-chull. The trading firm grew to become the
      present-day Samsung C&T Corporation. After a few years, Cho and Lee
      separated due to differences in management style. Cho wanted a 30 equity
      share. Samsung Group was separated into Samsung Group and Hyosung Group,
      Hankook Tire and other businesses.[17][18] In the late 1960s, Samsung
      Group entered the electronics industry. It formed several
      electronics-related divisions, such as Samsung Electronics Devices,
      Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Corning and Samsung Semiconductor &
      Telecommunications, and opened the facility in Suwon. Its first product
      was a black-and-white television set.[citation needed]
